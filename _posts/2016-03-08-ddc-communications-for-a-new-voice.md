When did you last:

* face a crisis situation with potential exposure on newspapers,broadcast and social media?
* feel nervous when facing a camera or talking into a microphone?
* had to endure a hostile phone call from aggrieved customers?
* meet people for the first time for a business meeting?

Sound communications practice helps you to take control of spoken and written communication in an assertive and productive manner. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/46313521-ad21-4908-892f-267b6a06d11f.jpg)
