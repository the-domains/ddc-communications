**When did you last:**

* _face a crisis situation with potential exposure on newspapers,broadcast and social media?_
* _feel nervous when facing a camera or talking into a microphone?_
* _had to endure a hostile phone call from aggrieved customers?_
* _meet people for the first time for a business meeting?_

Sound communications practice helps you to **take control** of spoken and written communication in an assertive and productive manner. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/46313521-ad21-4908-892f-267b6a06d11f.jpg)
